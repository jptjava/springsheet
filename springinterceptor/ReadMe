Following are some ways to write spring mvc interceptor.

Url interceptors and method interceptor(aop).

This example is of creating spring mvc url interceptor or http based interceptor


1. Create a Custom interceptor class by extending the class "HandlerInterceptorAdapter" 
	and provide override following method based on requirement.
	
    
    a.preHandle
    b.postHandle
    c.afterCompletion
    
	

2. Configure the interceptor on required path

	<!-- Configuring interceptors based on URI -->
    <mvc:interceptors>
        <mvc:interceptor>
            <mvc:mapping path="/user" />
            <bean class="CustomInterceptor"></bean>
        </mvc:interceptor>
    </mvc:interceptors>
